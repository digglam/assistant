OVERVIEW
========
This directory contains code from Aalto University's digGLAM project to record readings from Plugwise energy monitors and store those to a database. Plugwise energy monitors were used to measure the energy consumption of the semi-automated scanning of the digital assistant: robot, flatbed scanner, USB hubs to power the Arduino and webcam, and the total energy consumption.

digGLAM assistant
=================

digGLAM is a joint project by Aalto University's Media Laboratory and Department of Computer Science and Engineering, with support from Aalto University's Energy Science Initiative (http://energyscience.aalto.fi/en/). The project studies automating digitization of printed media items for small and medium sized Galleries, Libraries and Museums (GLAMs).

The project studies use of an automated assistant for scanning printed media items, and also the related energy consumption. The Gado2 robot of Project Gado (projectgado.org) was used as the basis for the digital assistant.

digGLAM assistant UI
====================
The digGLAM UI used by end users to start and run scanning sessions using a Gado2 robot is located under the “gado/digglam_UI” subdirectory. The subdirectories "ArduinoFirmware" and "Gado2" should be pulled from Project Gado's github repository, from here: https://github.com/ProjectGado/Project-Gado/tree/master/linux_src

Energy Readings
===============

The subdirectory "energy" was used for energy readings taken from Plugwise Energy monitors.

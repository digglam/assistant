This digGLAM assistant UI code controls a Gado2 robot. It scans multiple items and saves the artifacts to a database.
The UI also allows user to tag their runs or individual artifacts with text strings to describe them.

robot.py is a set of test commands to test the robot's functionality one-by-one before starting a scanning run.
